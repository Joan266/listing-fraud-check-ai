As a fraud analyst, compare the data from a rental listing against the official Google Maps data for the same address.
Note any major contradictions in the descriptions or reviews. Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object with a single key "inconsistencies".

The value for "inconsistencies" should be a list of JSON objects, where each object has two keys:
1. "type": A string, either "description" or "reviews".
2. "reason": A brief string explaining the discrepancy.

If they are consistent, return an empty list.
